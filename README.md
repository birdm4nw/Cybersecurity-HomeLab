# Cybersecurity HomeLab Project
![Diagram](images/homelab_diagram.jpg)
This project focuses on the development of a cybersecurity homelab by integrating various procedures, configurations, and technologies. Its primary objective is to illustrate how different components work together to simulate real-world IT environments on a small scale. The ultimate goal is to enhance understanding of the various security elements that interact to safeguard individuals and organizations in today's digital age.

## üë®üèº‚Äçüíª Performed tasks:
- DNS & DHCP servers configuration
- Setup **Active Directory** environment
- Configuring **OpenVPN** via LDAP on AD environment
- Setting up a firewall (**pfSense**)
- Monitoring and detecting security events with SIEM platform (**Splunk**)
- Performing vulnerability scans with **Nessus**
- Simulating a threat actor behavior using a Raspberry
- Troubleshooting operations across various operating systems

#### üß† Upon completion, this project will allow you to test and apply key skills relevant to the industry, including:

- Security auditing 
- Understanding of network protocols (TCP/IP, DHCP, DNS)
- Management of different operating systems (Linux, Windows, Unix & macOS)
- Problem-solving 
- Proficiency with virtualization software (VMWare, VirtualBox)
